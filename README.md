# KSValidator
The KnottySoft form validation library is written entirely in JavaScript and is compatible with all modern browsers and IE9 and above! The library was inspired by the canadian government's [wet-boew](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew) form validation (mostly the way it displayed the errors). I found it wasn't complete and couldn't do everything i wanted it to, hence why i wrote my own from scratch. <br><br>
The ksvalidator.js file contains all of the automated functions for static and dynamic forms, the library reads the predefined tags and their parameters (if any) to execute a specific task on the controls to be validated. The library is ligthweight, heavy duty and simple.

General Notice
-----------------
The form validation library core is largely completed but will more than likely undergo some changes until a stable version is released. The current *attributes* will not be changing however, some may be added but the names are pretty set-in which means the library can be added without issue to your forms. The *functions* however may more than likely be renamed down the line.
